# ComputerArchitecture
The theme of this project is cache design and how a caching processor generates and services address references.

This project will simulate a CPU cache (unified instruction/data) and integrate the cache into behavioral simulator. As the processor simulator executes an assembly-language program, it will access instructions and data. These accesses will be serviced by the cache, which will transfer data to/from memory as needed.
